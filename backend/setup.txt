net isk (isk killed - isk lost)
isk per active player
net isk per average corpmembers on killmails
The website displays that data and can show monthly and yearly aggregates over that data sorted by each column presenting a rank based of the selected sort column. Currently I work on a row that takes all other rows into account and yielding an official score
Average number of pilots in gangs and the number of active pilots in a

DB process:
add collections

Schema
1. corps we are currently tracking
    - corp
        - name
        - ticker
        - corp id

2. KMdump by corp
    - year
        - month
            - Corp
                - killmails

3. Stats
    - year
        - month
            - Corp
                - killed // increment
                - lossed // increment
                - net killed // diff (dependent)
                - effective % // figure out how to cal (dependent)
                - isk killed // zkb number
                - isk lossed // zkb number
                - net isk // diff (dependent)
                - ISK efficency % // isk killed / (isk killed and lost) (dependent)
                - active pvp // number of distinct pvper
                - total member // do we need this?
                - % active pvp (dependent)
                - net isk/ active pvp (dependent)
                ? Average fleet size (dependent, need to record size)
                - net points // net points given by zkb
                - net points per active pilot
                
                Stuff to maintain on the side
                - list of pilotId with kill (active pvp)
                - average gang size (numbers on km)


KM process process
Two types
    a. from history (once during startup)
    b. from real time

0.1.
    Find list of active WH corps
    take last 24 hours of all w space kills
    do a dfs tree search (recursive)
        1. read past 7 day kill mail for corp
        2. find kills in wh and corpid
        3. if corpid doesn't exist in db, add corpid to active wh pvp corp list
        4. do this for 2-3 levels of tree height depending on number of corps
    end

1. From history
    a. Dating back to 12 months ago
    b. form api request like this (https://zkillboard.com/api/w-space/corporationID/CORPID/year/2019/month/12/)
    c. loop through corporationIds and Month to get list of kms
        1. during loop we call ccp api with kmId and Hash using https://esi.evetech.net/latest/killmails/KMID/hash/?datasource=tranquility
        2. apply km json to documents
        3. change aggregates every batch (in hopes that each batch has multiple kms belonging to the same corp in the same fight)


2. From Real time
    a. call https://redisq.zkillboard.com/listen.php on loop
    a2. check if location is WH (3100xxxx)
    b. keep calling until you get null
    c. apply results to kms collection and update stats collection everytime we hit a null stop (batch complete)
    d.
